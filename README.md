<h1 align='center'>The Grand Open-Source Tax Application Project</h1>

FileME is a part of the Grand Open-Source Tax Application Project to release a secure open-source tax return software for Canadians at no cost that is comparable to the best-in-class competitor. The idea of paying a tax filing tax for the priviledge of filing a tax return that is then taxed on top of a taxed is wrong. It is wrong to pay a cubed tax!
